LinkMind: Sovereign Network AI (v101.0)
The "Godfather" of Network Optimization.
LinkMind is a state-aware, autonomous NetDevOps system designed to manage the lifecycle of Huawei RTN Microwave networks. Unlike traditional monitoring scripts, LinkMind operates as a Sovereign Entity—it doesn't just report errors; it investigates them, enforces a "Probation Period" for stability, and executes "RICO Act" protocols to reclaim wasted resources (Licenses, Spectrum, Power) in a single, calculated strike.

⚡ Key Capabilities:
⚖️ The Godfather Protocol: Implements a strict judicial system (Probation/Redemption) to differentiate between transient network glitches and habitual resource waste.

💰 Quant-Driven ROI: Translates technical metrics (Mbps, MHz) into financial statements ($ USD), optimizing OPEX with mathematical precision.

🛡️ Sovereign Safety: Features defensive parsing, auto-vendor detection, and dry-run audit trails to ensure zero-risk operations.

⚔️ RICO Act Execution: Aggregates multiple offenses (License Hoarding + Spectrum Waste + Zombie Ports) into a single batch remediation script for maximum efficiency.
